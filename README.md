# OCR-CTPN-CRNN
  
  
CNN+LSTM (CTPN/CRNN) for image text detection and recognition
  
  
### description
 Â 
  
To run this repo:
  
1, normalize the pre-normalize background images: python data_base_normalize.py
  
2, generate validation data: python data_generator.py 0
  
3, generate training data: python data_generator.py 1
  
4, train and validate: python script_detect.py
  
By 1, the pre-normalized images will firstly be rescaled if not of size 800x600, then 800x600 rects will be cropped from the rescaled images. The 800x600 images will be stored in a newly-maked directory, images_base/.
  
By 2 and 3, validation data and training data will be generated. These will be store in the newly-maked directories, data_test/ and data_generated/, respectively.
  
By 4, the model will be trained and validated. The validation results will be stored in data_test/results/ . The ckpt files will be stored in a newly-maked directory, model_detect/.



### detection model
  
The model is mainly based on the method described in the article:

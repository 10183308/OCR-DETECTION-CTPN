The Quality of Life Is Measured by Little Things

Chen Huijun

  We each long to do something great with our life. But what is

greatness? How can a person really make an impact on the world

around them? How can we ex-perience the quality of life? The

definition of the qual-ity of life may differ from person to person.

The way for people to achieve a quality of life may vary from one

another.

  However one thing is certain, the quality of life is measured by

little things.

"Every day we're called to do small things with great love." Thus

claimed the U.S. President Gorge W. Bush in his inaugural speech.

Through touching every little thing, Helen Keller knew the outer

world, and longed for three days to see to emphasize sharply the

values of life.And I still remember my childhood dream was to become

a millionaire so I could bring about a happy life to my parents. But

now it seems that by frequent going back home, or a simple phone

call to my family on a very ordinary day or a letter enclosed with a

smiling picture of me makes thern even happier. How much greater

difference can these little things make than a million yuan.

  The so-called little things are merely the causes of great things;

they are the beginning, the embryo, and it is the point of

departure, which generally speaking, decides the whole future of the

quality of life.

  To strengthen the relationship with my friends, I always wonder,

how can it really work without our mu-tual understanding and support

by communication. To show my sincere appreciation for my

teachers'persis-tence in giving the lectures when they are ill, what

can be better than extending a cup of tea to them during the break

or a piece of greeting words. To fulfill my obligation to society,

I'd like to begin from giving my hands and showing my love to those

in need.

  It is by studying the little things that we attain the great art

of having a quality life. Life is long, but no matter how long it

takes me to go, I should and will cover it little by little and

reach the climax of my life at last, for I believe constant dripping

wears away a stone.

  So enjoy your life by doing the little things, for little things

are what inspire great things.

  Thank you!
